# FCP-CORONAHOW TO RUN THE PROGRAMME:The programme can be run in two ways; 1) With arguments inputted by the user 2) Using pre set scenarios To run the programme using your own arguemtns type ./MAIN -h which will output the following:-  --size N         Use a N x N simulation grid-  --cities N       Create N cities-  --duration T     Simulate for T days-  --distancing P   Proportion of empty grid squares-  --recovery P     Probability of recovery (per day)-  --infection P    Probability of infecting a neighbour (per day)-  --reinfection P  Probability of losing immunity (per day)-  --death P        Probability of dying when infected (per day)-  --cases N        Number of initial infections-  --vaccinate P    Probability of vaccination (per day)-  --quarantine P   Probability of quarantine when infected (per day)-  --travel P       Probability of travelling while infected (per day)-  --plot           Generate plots instead of an animation-  --file N         Filename to save to instead of showing on screen-  --sim N          Run predetermined simulationThese are all the different arguments, when entering a probability ensure the value is between 0 and 1. If the user chooses not to use thier own argument for some of the arguments a default value will be used. e.g. if the user didn't choose a death probability then the default value 0.002087 will be used. The default values chosen from real world data (see report for referencing) are as follows.- size = 50 x 50- cities = 2- duration = 100 days- distancing = 0.05- recovery = 0.1- infection = 0.3- reinfection = 0.005- death = 0.002087- cases = 5- vaccinate = 0.0001 - quarentine = 0.15- travel = 0.1For example, if you wanted to run a simulation with 5 cities, 100x100 grid, 60% chance of infection and a 5%death rate. You would write:$ ./MAIN.py --cities=5 --size=100 --infection=0.5 --death=0.05https://github.com/FelixxDP/FCP-CORONA.gitHOW TO RUN PREDETERMINED SIMULATIONS:There are 12 predetermined simulations that can be run by typing:$ ./MAIN.py --sim=N  # Where N is any number between 1-12The 11 Scenarios are as follows (if an argument is not specified it has taken its default value):1) Multiple different sized cities- 6 cities with pTravel = 0.01 and pRandomInfection = 0.0022) Multiple cities with Large amounts of travel- Same 6 cities as previous however pTravel = 0.33) Effect of Social Distancing- 5 50x50 cities with the following distancing 0.15, 0.3, 0.45, 0.6, 0.75 with pTravel = 0.014) High Quarentine vs Low Quarentine Rates- City 1 pQuarentine = 1 and pEndQuaretine = 0 i.e. immediately entering quarentine when infected and not leaving till uninfected- City 2 pQuarentine = 0.4 and pEndQuarentine 0.05- City 3 pQuarentine = 0- All have no infected travel5) High Vaccine rate vs Low Vaccine rate (75x75 cities)- City 1 pVaccine = 0.1- City 2 pVaccine = 0.033- City 3 pVaccine = 06) 3 Cities with different control measures (75x75 cities))- City 1 pVaccine = 0.033, pQuarantine = 0.95, pTravel = 0, pDistancing = 0.3, pRecovery = 0.2 i.e. some vaccinations, almost everyone infected goes into quaretnine, no travelling and large amount of distancing- City 2 pVaccination = 0.01, pQuarentine = 0.3, pTravel = 0.1, pRecovery = 0.1, pDistancing = 0.1 i.e. less vaccines, less distancing and less quarentining and a longer recovery time with more travel- City 3 pVaccination = 0, pQuarantine = 0, pDistancing = 0, pTravel = 0.3, pRecovery = 0.075 i.e. no Measures in place, longer recovery time andmore travelling7) Effect of Different Death Rates- 3 cities with no travel 75x75- pDeath = 0.002, 0.1, 0.98) Vaccine against no vaccines- Cite 1 pVaccination = 0.1 which is introduced after 8 days- City 2 pVaccination = 0 (this leads to multiple waves)101) Mild Recovery rate case- One city with pRecovery = 0.6 and pReinfection = 0.05 this shows the effect of immunity loss which creates several spikes 102) Rapid Recovery case- One city with  pRecovery = 0.99 and pReinfection = 0.05 103) Oscilating SIR pattern case- One city, pRecovery = 0.7, Preinfection = 0.025 and pTravel = 0104) Poorer Areas Simulation (simulates a Deadly virus in poorer Areas)- One city with pRecovery = 0, pDeath = 0.1 and pTravel = 0105) Rapid Spread and Death- One city 200x200, pDeath=0.9, pTravel = 0.2 and pInfection = 0.99106) Rapid spread and rapid reinfection- One city pInfection = 0.99, pRecovery = 0.99, pTravel = 0 and pReinfection = 0.99So for example if One was to run simulation 106 they would write:$ ./MAIN.py --sim=106
